Extinction Rebellion is an international movement that uses non-violent civil disobedience in an attempt to halt mass extinction and minimise the risk of social collapse.

After the November blockades of the five main bridges in London, Extinction Rebellion became a bit more known here in Spain. A group of thirty people motivated to do something similar here, decided to gather at a caf√© on the 28th of December of 2018. That day, after a long deliberation, Extinction Rebellion Barcelona was born. 

We got to the conclusion that the Extinction Rebellion campaign was a big opportunity to unify forces all over the world, and fight against the de facto powers that are leading us to the destruction of the ecosystems, and human extinction. 

Since then, we have been working in cooperation with other national groups and international groups, as well as with other local movements that align with our demands and principles.
